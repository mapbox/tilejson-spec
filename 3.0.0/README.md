# 1. Purpose

This specification attempts to create a standard for representing metadata about multiple types of web-based map layers, to aid clients in configuration and browsing.

# 2. File Format

TileJSON manifest files use the JSON format as described in [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).

# 3. Structure

Implementations MUST treat unknown keys as if they weren't present. However, implementations MUST expose unknown key/values so users can optionally handle these keys. Implementations MUST treat invalid values for keys as if they werenâ€™t present. If the the field is an optional field and the value is invalid, the default value MAY be applied. If the key is required, implementations MUST treat the entire TileJSON manifest file as invalid and refuse operation.

## 3.1 `attribution`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

Contains an attribution to be displayed when the map is shown to a user. Implementations MAY decide to treat this as HTML or literal text. For security reasons, make absolutely sure that this field can't be abused as a vector for XSS or beacon tracking.

```JSON
{
  "attribution": "<a href='http://openstreetmap.org'>OSM contributors</a>"
}
```

## 3.2 `bounds`

OPTIONAL. Default: [ -180, -85.05112877980659, 180, 85.0511287798066 ] (xyz-compliant tile bounds)

The maximum extent of available map tiles. Bounds MUST define an area covered by all zoom levels. The bounds are represented in WGS 84 latitude and longitude values, in the order left, bottom, right, top. Values may be integers or floating point numbers. The minimum/maximum values for longitude and latitude are -180/180 and -90/90 respectively. Bounds MUST NOT "wrap" around the ante-meridian. If bounds are not present, the default value MAY assume the set of tiles is globally distributed.

```JSON
{
  "bounds": [ -180, -85.05112877980659, 180, 85.0511287798066 ]
}
```

## 3.3 `center`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

The first value is the longitude, the second is latitude (both in WGS:84 values), the third value is the zoom level as an integer. Longitude and latitude MUST be within the specified bounds. The zoom level MUST be between minzoom and maxzoom. Implementations MAY use this center value to set the default location. If the value is null, implementations MAY use their own algorithm for determining a default location.

```JSON
{
  "center": [ -76.275329586789, 39.153492567373, 8 ]
}
```

## 3.4 `data`
## 3.5 `description`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

A text description of the tileset. The description can contain any valid unicode character as described by the JSON specification [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).

```JSON
{
  "description": "We are volcanoes. When we women offer our experience as our truth, as human truth, all the maps change. There are new mountains."
}
```

## 3.6 `grids`

OPTIONAL. Default: [].

An array of interactivity endpoints. {z}, {x} and {y}, if present, are replaced with the corresponding integers. If multiple endpoints are specified, clients may use any combination of endpoints. All endpoints MUST return the same content for the same URL. If the array doesn't contain any entries, UTF-Grid interactivity is not supported for this tileset. See https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec/tree/master/1.2 for the interactivity specification.

```JSON
{
  "grids": [
    "http://www.example.com/earthsea/1.0.0/{z}/{x}/{y}.grid.json"
  ]
}
```

## 3.7 `legend`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

Contains a legend to be displayed with the map. Implementations MAY decide to treat this as HTML or literal text. For security reasons, make absolutely sure that this field can't be abused as a vector for XSS or beacon tracking.

```JSON
{
  "legend": "Dangerous zones are red, safe zones are green"
}
```

## 3.8 `maxzoom`

OPTIONAL. Default: 30. >= 0, <= 30.

An integer specifying the maximum zoom level. MUST be >= minzoom.

```JSON
{
  "maxzoom": "11"
}
```

## 3.9 `minzoom`

OPTIONAL. Default: 0. >= 0, <= 30.

An integer specifying the minimum zoom level. MUST be <= maxzoom

```JSON
{
  "minzoom": "0"
}
```

## 3.10 `name`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

A name describing the tileset. The name can contain any legal character. Implementations SHOULD NOT interpret the name as HTML.

```JSON
{
  "name": "Earthsea v2"
}
```

## 3.11 `scheme`

OPTIONAL. Default: "xyz".

Either "xyz" or "tms". Influences the y direction of the tile coordinates. The global-mercator (aka Spherical Mercator) profile is assumed.

```JSON
{
  "scheme": "xyz"
}
```

## 3.12 `template`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

Contains a mustache template to be used to format data from grids for interaction. See https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec/tree/master/1.2 for the interactivity specification.

```JSON
{
  "template": "{{#__teaser__}}{{NAME}}{{/__teaser__}}"
}
```

## 3.13 `tilejson`

REQUIRED.

A semver.org style version number as a string. Describes the version of the TileJSON spec that is implemented by this JSON object.

```JSON
{
  "tilejson": "3.0.0"
}
```

## 3.14 `tiles`

REQUIRED.

An array of tile endpoints. {z}, {x} and {y}, if present, are replaced with the corresponding integers. If multiple endpoints are specified, clients may use any combination of endpoints. All endpoints MUST return the same content for the same URL. The array MUST contain at least one endpoint. The tile extension is NOT limited to any particular format. Some of the more popular are: mvt, vector.pbf, png, webp, and jpg.

```JSON
{
  "tiles": [
    "http://localhost:8888/admin/1.0.0/world-light,broadband/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt"
  ]
}
```

## 3.15 `vector_layers`
## 3.16 `version`

OPTIONAL. Default: "1.0.0".

A [semver.org](https://semver.org) style version number of the tiles. When changes across tiles are introduced the minor version MUST change. This may lead to cut off labels. Therefore, implementors can decide to clean their cache when the minor version changes. Changes to the patch level MUST only have changes to tiles that are contained within one tile. When tiles change significantly, such as updating a vector tile layer name, the major version MUST be increased. Implementations MUST NOT use tiles with different major versions.

```JSON
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
