# 1. Purpose

This specification attempts to create a standard for representing metadata about multiple types of web-based map layers, to aid clients in configuration and browsing.

# 2. File Format

TileJSON manifest files use the JSON format as described in [RFC 4627](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

# 3. Structure

Implementations MUST treat unknown keys as if they weren't present. However, implementations MUST expose unknown key/values in their API so that API users can optionally handle these keys. Implementations MUST treat invalid values for keys as if they werenâ€™t present. If the the field is an optional field and the value is invalid, the default value MAY be applied. If the key is required, implementations MUST treat the entire TileJSON manifest file as invalid and refuse operation.

## 3.1 `attribution`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

Contains an attribution to be displayed when the map is shown to a user. Implementations MAY decide to treat this as HTML or literal text. For security reasons, make absolutely sure that this field can't be abused as a vector for XSS or beacon tracking.

```JSON
{
  "attribution": "<a href='http://openstreetmap.org'>OSM contributors</a>"
}
```

## 3.2 `bounds`

OPTIONAL. Default: [-180, -90, 180, 90].

The maximum extent of available map tiles. Bounds MUST define an area covered by all zoom levels. The bounds are represented in WGS:84 latitude and longitude values, in the order left, bottom, right, top. Values may be integers or floating point numbers. The minimum/maximum values for longitude and latitude are -180/180 and -90/90 respectively. Bounds MUST NOT "wrap" around the ante-meridian. If bounds are not present, the default value MAY assume the set of tiles is globally distributed.

```JSON
{
  "bounds": [ -180, -85.05112877980659, 180, 85.0511287798066 ]
}
```

## 3.3 `center`
## 3.4 `data`
## 3.5 `description`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

A text description of the tileset. The description can contain any legal character. Implementations SHOULD NOT interpret the description as HTML.

```JSON
{
  "description": "We are volcanoes. When we women offer our experience as our truth, as human truth, all the maps change. There are new mountains."
}
```

## 3.6 `grids`
## 3.7 `legend`

## 3.8 `maxzoom`

OPTIONAL. Default: 30. >= 0, <= 30.

An integer specifying the maximum zoom level. MUST be >= minzoom.

```JSON
{
  "maxzoom": "11"
}
```

## 3.9 `minzoom`

OPTIONAL. Default: 0. >= 0, <= 30.

An integer specifying the minimum zoom level. MUST be <= maxzoom

```JSON
{
  "minzoom": "0"
}
```

## 3.10 `name`

OPTIONAL. Default: null.

A name describing the tileset. The name can contain any legal character. Implementations SHOULD NOT interpret the name as HTML.

```JSON
{
  "name": "Earthsea v2"
}
```

## 3.11 `scheme`

OPTIONAL. Default: "xyz".

Either "xyz" or "tms". Influences the y direction of the tile coordinates. The global-mercator (aka Spherical Mercator) profile is assumed.

```JSON
{
  "scheme": "xyz"
}
```

## 3.12 `template`
## 3.13 `tilejson`

REQUIRED.

A semver.org style version number. Describes the version of the TileJSON spec that is implemented by this JSON object.

```JSON
{
  "tilejson": "3.0"
}
```

## 3.14 `tiles`

REQUIRED.

An array of tile endpoints. {z}, {x} and {y}, if present, are replaced with the corresponding integers. If multiple endpoints are specified, clients may use any combination of endpoints. All endpoints MUST return the same content for the same URL. The array MUST contain at least one endpoint. The tile extension is NOT limited to any particular format. Some of the more popular are: mvt, vector.pbf, png, webp, and jpg.

```JSON
{
  "tiles": [
    "http://localhost:8888/admin/1.0.0/world-light,broadband/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt"
  ]
}
```

## 3.15 `vector_layers`

REQUIRED. (if describing vector tiles)

A JSON object whose value is an array of JSON objects. Each of those JSON objects describes one layer of vector tile data, and MUST contain the following key-value pairs:

* `id` (string): The layer ID, which is referred to as the `name` of the layer in the [Mapbox Vector Tile spec](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1#41-layers).
* `fields` (object): A JSON object whose keys and values are the names and descriptions of attributes available in this layer. Each value (description) MUST be a string. The values MAY describe the underlying data type, such as `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean`. Attributes whose type varies between features MAY be listed as `"String"`.

Each layer object MAY also contain the following key-value pair:

* `description` (string): A human-readable description of the layer's contents.
* `minzoom` (number): The lowest zoom level whose tiles this layer appears in. MUST be greater than or equal to the tileset's `minzoom`.
* `maxzoom` (number): The highest zoom level whose tiles this layer appears in. MUST be less than or equal to the tileset's `maxzoom`.

These keys are used to describe the situation where different sets of vector layers appear in different zoom levels of the same tileset, for example in a case where a "minor roads" layer is only present at high zoom levels.

Implementations MUST treat unknown key-value pairs as if they weren't present. However, implementations MUST expose unknown key/values in their API so that API users can optionally handle these keys.

```JSON
{
  "vector_layers": [
    {
      "id": "roads",
      "description": "Roads and their attributes",
      "minzoom": 2,
      "maxzoom": 16,
      "fields": {
        "type": "One of: trunk, primary, secondary",
        "lanes": "Number",
        "name": "String",
        "sidewalks": "Boolean"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "countries",
      "description": "Admin 0 (country) boundaries",
      "minzoom": 0,
      "maxzoom": 16,
      "fields": {
        "iso": "ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code",
        "name": "English name of the country",
        "name_ar": "Arabic name of the country"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


## 3.16 `version`

OPTIONAL. Default: "1.0.0".

A [semver.org](https://semver.org) style version number of the tiles. When changes across tiles are introduced the minor version MUST change. This may lead to cut off labels. Therefore, implementors can decide to clean their cache when the minor version changes. Changes to the patch level MUST only have changes to tiles that are contained within one tile. When tiles change significantly, such as updating a vector tile layer name, the major version MUST be increased. Implementations MUST NOT use tiles with different major versions.

```JSON
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
